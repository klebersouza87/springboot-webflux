# This is a simple project with Spring Boot and WebFlux

Spring WebFlux is part of Spring 5 and provides a fully non-blocking, annotation-based web framework built on Project Reactor that makes it possible to build reactive applications on the HTTP layer. WebFlux uses a new router functions feature to apply functional programming to the web layer and bypass declarative controllers and RequestMappings.
